WEB-Brain is a mini search engine which is designed to search for information from a list of around 100 URLs. These 100 URLs are compromised of our basic subjects, for example mathematics, finance, environmental studies, signals & systems and micro-processor
Web-Brain is basically divided into three parts like any other search engine which are as follows:
1. A query handler that answers user queries using the index.
2. A crawler that retrieves web pages to be put into the engineâ€™s collection of web pages.
3. An indexer that builds the index, which is the main data structure used by the search engine and represents the crawled web pages.
